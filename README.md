Title : Your Favorite Movie Colletion WebSite (Web Application)
I usually like to watch movies.
Therefore, I made an MVC Web application that can input information about various movies using movie posters.
The films registered here are films that have been recived a Good rate from many people.
The user may additionally register information of a desired movie.

I thought of a few elements while making this table screen.
I first created a column for entering the title of the movie and 
a column for entering the year of the first screening of the movie.

Each movie is automatically assigned a unique ID and can be stored in the database.
It allows you to enter the name of the director of the movie and how long the movie will run.
Finally, this Web Application was configured so that the movie information could be updated with 
the correct information by editing and deleting the wrong information.
